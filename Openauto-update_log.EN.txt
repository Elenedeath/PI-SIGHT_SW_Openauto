Solved the problem of key mapping not working when changing to pynput and re-pairing
1,2,h cannot be operated with pynput, so only pynput is used for key recognition, and keyboard is used for operation.
Add the detect code, turn off the hotspot and wait until the remote control is connected after booting, then turn on the hotspot once connected.
If you use rfkill in bootrun, it seems like the hotspot is completely turned off, so apply rfkill only to the detect code.
